### Forward Secrecy

Forward Secrecy or Perfect Forward Secrecy is a property of a cipher suite 
that ensures confidentiality even if the server key has been compromised.
Thus if traffic has been recorded it can not be decrypted even if an adversary
has got hold of the server key[^wp][^eff][^netcraft].
